I wish to create a test revision app that allows a student to create a quiz set by entering up to 20 
custom questions with four answer options of their choice for each question. With one answer to be 
marked as correct and the rest set as incorrect. The user can then save their question set for  
use in a quiz.

The main purpose of the app is the quiz which allows a student to play a quiz based on a question 
set they have previously created. So they can test their knowledge for an upcoming test. 
I want to include a high score tab that compares previous quiz attempts with the current quiz 
attempt, along with a share option for student's to share their test scores. Sending emails attached 
with their results I.e. You scored 16 out of 20!

The motivation to develop this app comes from experience of using existing revision tools to help
memorize information for a test. However, the reason I wish to create a app for this purpose 
is that I would like a simplified interface without the extraneous features of existing apps 
or having to be online to access the quizzes I have created.
