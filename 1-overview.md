I wish to create a test quizzer app that allows a student to create quiz sets by linking 
questions attached with four answer options of their choice to a created tag. With one option for the
question to be marked as the correct answer by the student. A tagging system will be implemented, 
so questions can be associated with tags, allowing a questions to be included in a certain tag(category)
to create a quiz I.e. questions for the programming tag are used to create a quiz with a category of programming. 

The main purpose of the app for the questions in a tag to be played through as a quiz and have the score tracked. 
Features I wish to include are a high score screen to view/compare when high scores were achieved, 
along with a share option for student's to share their quiz high score I.e. by email.

The motivation to develop this app comes from experience of using existing revision tools to help
memorize information for tests. The reason I wish to create an app for this purpose 
is that I would like a simplified interface without the extraneous features of existing apps.
