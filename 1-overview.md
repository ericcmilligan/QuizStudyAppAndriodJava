I wish to create a test quizzer app that allows a student to create quiz sets by entering up to 20 
questions attached with four answer options of their choice for each set. With one option for the
question to be marked as correct by the user. There will be tagging system implemented, 
so question sets can be sorted into categories, allowing a question set to be included in more than
one quiz I.e. a programming and C# assigned tag means the question set will be included in the C# 
and programming quiz categories. 

The main purpose of the app is the use of the tags to generate quiz categories that the student can
play through as a quiz with their score tracked. Features I want to include are a high score 
tab that compares previous quiz attempts with the current quiz attempt, along with a share option for 
student's to share their quiz scores I.e. by email.

The motivation to develop this app comes from experience of using existing revision tools to help
memorize information for a test. The reason I wish to create a app for this purpose 
is that I would like a simplified interface without the extraneous features of existing apps.
