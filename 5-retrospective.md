**Mobile Development 2022/23 Portfolio**
# Retrospective

Student ID: `C21040245`

At the end of the development period, I was able to meet all the requirements defined 
and the features work as I intended. I followed the wireframe design I made and implemented
the design I mocked-up during the design stage. I was able to fix issues that cropped up during the development period
by utilizing the android documentation and the course material as well as using external web resources
such as StackOverflow. 

Next time, I would change the stated purpose of the app to allow for more android API features to be used, 
for example using the opensource trivia API to auto-generate questions for a given category, I could have implemented 
this into the app developed, but I felt it would confuse the use of the app which is for students to create their own 
question sets. 

With more time for extra features, I would have liked to include an accessibility mode to enable users with different 
disabilities to use the app. I would have also had liked to include online account features, so a user
can for example login with a Google account and have their tag with the questions saved to their 
Google account for backup.
