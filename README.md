App Name: Test Quizzer

This is the repository housing the test quizzer app and associated write-up that 
I have developed for the mobile development(CM6226) assessment. The app may ask for 
storage and internet permissions, storage is used for exporting questions to a text file 
and internet for loading a GIF from the Giphy API for the end of quiz screen.

During development, I have tested the app using the emulator within android studio 
loaded with a Pixel 4 XL phone. I also tested using my physical Pixel 6 phone.

There is an in-app tutorial accessible from the home screen of the app that guides through the 
question manager, quiz game and high score sections of the app. There are also helper buttons 
shown with a question mark icon within the different sections of the app that explain how 
to use the current section of the app you are in.
